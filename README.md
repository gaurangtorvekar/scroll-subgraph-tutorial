# Hello World!

I created this project to help the Scroll community with an easy way to create a local Graph node and deploy their subgraph. 

This tutorial is divided into three parts, and while each part individually has a lot of great tutorials out there, I found that there are only a few tutorials that focused on all three parts combined and catered towards the Scroll network in particular.

## Scroll zkEVM

[Scroll](https://scroll.io/) is a zkEVM-based zkRollup on Ethereum that enables native compatibility for existing Ethereum applications and tools. It is a L2 solution on top of Ethereum, meant to scale the network and cater to the mainstream audience when blockchain adoption grows by leaps and bounds over the next few years.
